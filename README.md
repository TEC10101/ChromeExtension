# ChromeExtension

I'm building an extension to organize a Learning Track for an individual.  They can add webpages to build a linear learning track for themselves.  

Allows for multiple Tracks to be created and cross-linked together.

Learning tracks can be published and downloaded for import into the extension.

# At its core, this extension will be a bookmark manager.
## Start there.

Planned additions (no order):
- option for displaying job wishList (can use this for motivation!)
- configure a timeline with chronology, ability to "schedule" into google calendar
-
